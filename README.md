## Installation (automated)
This is the recommended way to install the API on the game.

## Installation (manual)
To install this plugin first you need to install BepInEx as a mod loader for Inscryption. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html#where-to-download-bepinex). Inscryption needs the 86x (32 bit) mono version.

You will also need to install the [CardLoaderPlugin](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionAPI)
To install Inscryption API you simply need to copy **API.dll** from [releases](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionAPI/releases) to **Inscryption/BepInEx/plugins**.

To install ExampleMod with just the default examples, you simply need to copy **ExampleMod.dll** and the **Artwork** folder from the source code zip in [releases](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionExampleMod/releases) to a **Cyantist-ExampleMod** folder inside **Inscryption/BepInEx/plugins**.
